Perform a 3D Bernard Cell simulation using OpenFOAM buoyantFoam solver. The computational domain spans 9 m x 1 m x 2 m. The simulation begins at t=0 seconds and runs until t = 1000 seconds with a time step of 1 second, and results are written at intervals of every 50 seconds. One wall has a temperature of 305 K, while the other has a temperature of 290 K.

## Output contract

Write a single Python 3 script that creates the complete OpenFOAM case in the current working directory. The script must create (with os.makedirs / open().write(), plain string contents):

- system/blockMeshDict, system/controlDict, system/fvSchemes, system/fvSolution
- constant/ ... (all dictionaries the solver needs, e.g. momentumTransport, physicalProperties, turbulenceProperties, etc.)
- 0/ ... (initial fields the solver needs)
- Allrun  (shell script: source $WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/tools/RunFunctions, then runApplication blockMesh and runApplication <solver>)

Requirements:
- OpenFOAM version 10 (Foundation) dict syntax.
- endTime / writeInterval chosen so the run finishes quickly (a few seconds to ~1 min) and writes at least one time directory.
- The solver name in controlDict (application) must match the Allrun invocation.
- Use only os, math and built-ins in the script. Do not execute OpenFOAM commands from the script — only write files.

Respond with a single ```python code block and nothing else.
