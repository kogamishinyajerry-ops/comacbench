do an incompressible lid driven cavity flow using pisoFoam. The cavity is a square with dimensions normalized to 1 unit on both the x and y axes and very thin in the z-direction (0.1 units) and entire domain scaled down by a factor of 0.1 making it effectively 2D. Use a grid of 20X20 in x and y direction and 1 cell in z-direction(due to the expected 2D flow characteristics). The top wall ('movingWall') moves in the x-direction with a uniform velocity of 3m/s. The 'fixedWalls' have a no-slip boundary condition (velocity equal to zero at the wall). The front and back faces are designated as 'empty'. The simulation runs from time 0 to 10 with a time step of 0.005 units, and results are output every 100 time steps. The viscosity (`nu`) is set as constant with a value of 1e-03 m^2/s.

## Output contract

Write a single Python 3 script that creates the complete OpenFOAM case in the current working directory. The script must create (with os.makedirs / open().write(), plain string contents):

- system/blockMeshDict, system/controlDict, system/fvSchemes, system/fvSolution
- constant/ ... (all dictionaries the solver needs, e.g. momentumTransport, physicalProperties, turbulenceProperties, etc.)
- 0/ ... (initial fields the solver needs)
- Allrun  (shell script: source $WM_PROJECT_DIR/bin/tools/RunFunctions, then runApplication blockMesh and runApplication <solver>)

Requirements:
- OpenFOAM version 10 (Foundation) dict syntax.
- endTime / writeInterval chosen so the run finishes quickly (a few seconds to ~1 min) and writes at least one time directory.
- The solver name in controlDict (application) must match the Allrun invocation.
- Use only os, math and built-ins in the script. Do not execute OpenFOAM commands from the script — only write files.

Respond with a single ```python code block and nothing else.
